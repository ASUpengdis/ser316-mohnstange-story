Story
One day I was driving my BMW while wearing my Lederhose, when I saw a perfectly good bratwurst sitting in the middle of the road.
I was in a hurry though, and with my Flughafen broken, I knew I couldn't rescue that perfecly good bratwurst without being late and smelly at my destination.
Before I could figure out a way to save the bratwurst on the Hauptstrasse, as I drove by it my Hund jumped out of the BMW and grabbed the bratwurst.
